# Print Folder

Print folder is a package that helps making the barrier to print something much lower.

Now you can finally take your enture codebase and print it with the printer so you can start reading it outside in the sun! ☀️

# Usage

`npx print-folder .`

The above command will create a pdf containing all text files in your CWD. Careful, may be a bit slow!

# Features

- Works with serverless optimised version of puppeteer (same as [here](https://www.umuttufanoglu.dev/blog/using-puppeteer-in-nextjs))
- Prints all text-only pages into a HTML based on its markdown.
- HTML is printed directly
