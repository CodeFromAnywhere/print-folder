    - If it's a URL, download it into zip if it's downloadable and get the right chunk (e.g. github, drive, dropbox, wetransfer)
    - If it's a URL but no download can be found, look up the sitemap and scrape from the URL itself to find all paths that in scope of the URL
    - If it's a zipped file, unzip it and use the folder.
    - If it's a folder that is already on my file system, good.
